superionic_ai
==============================




A heirarchical screening workflow to discover superionic conductors


## Local Installation

The following steps assume that you use MacOS or some Linux flavor. If you use Windows, we recommend that you first install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).


We recommend that you create a virtual conda environment on your computer in which you install the dependencies for this exercise. To do so head over to [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and follow the installation instructions there.

Then, use

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -n superionic_ai
```

You can activate this environment using

```bash
conda activate superionic_ai
```


Create a new folder and clone this repository (you need `git` for this, if you get a `missing command` error for `git` you can install it with `sudo apt-get install git`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n0w0f/superionic_ai.git
cd superionic_ai
pip install -e .
```


## ðŸ’ª Getting Started

```bash
cd src
python3 main.py
```
